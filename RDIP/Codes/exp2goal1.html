  <p>The objective of this experiment is to impart basic knowledge knowledge about the distinction between types and tockens</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Select corpus from the dropdown</li>
   <li>There is also a message written to “Enter the number of tokens and types for the above corpus:” followed by a table saying #Types and #Tokens. There is also a submit button.</li>
   <li> According to the message, our objective is to enter the correct number of tokens and types from the corpus using the description that unique words from the corpus are types and all words are tokens.</li>
   <li>If we do not enter 169 and 80 i.e. the count of the types and tokens in the table and the answer is checked the boxes turn red. If the boxes turn red(even one of them), an error message is displayed saying Wrong Answer.</li>
   <li> If the answer is correct though(both have to be correct), another button is displayed along with the message Right Answer that says Continue, and when that button is clicked, the right answer message and the submit button vanishes. </li>
   <li> If the answer is correct though(both have to be correct), another button is displayed along with the message Right Answer that says Continue, and when that button is clicked, the right answer message and the submit button vanishes. </li>
   <li> They are replaced by the message “Now, consider all the tokens with the same 'root' word to be of the same type. Recalculate the number of types.” There is also a box that says, #NewTypes, and a new submit button below this. We can get new types from stemming concept</li>
